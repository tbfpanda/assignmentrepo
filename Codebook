d. ytest : "y_test.txt". Changed to ytest1 in tbl_df format.
e. subjecttest: "subject_test.txt". Changed to subjecttest1 in tbl_df format.
f. subjecttrain: "subject_train.txt".  Changed to subjecttrain1 in tbl_df format.
g. feature: "features.txt". Changed to tbl_df format and assigned to same variable name.

2. Libraries imported.

b. tidyverse
c. reshape
d. reshape2
e. janitor

3. Variables encountered in data file.
a. tags: The solitary column of features, containing all the column headings of xtrain1 and xtest1.
b. ytest2: Changed the numbers to labels from ytest1 data to apply to the xtest1 activity column we made (walking, lying etc.)
c. ytrain2: Changed numbers to labels from ytrain1 data to apply to xtrain1 activity column we made (walking, standing, lying etc.)
d. bigdata: It is the combination of data sets xtest1 and xtest1 together, horizontally, one on top of another.
e. gbigdata: Just a reassignment of bigdata. Eases in demarcating new procedures.
g. gbigdata1: Selecting columns with mean from gbigdata and putting it here.
h. gbigdata2: Selecting columns with std from gbigdata and putting them here.
i. gfbigdata: Combining gbigdata1 and gbigdata2 here.
j. expdata: A data frame form of gfbigdata as tbl_df form was causing problems with melting and casting
k. edata: Melted form of expdata
l. finaldataset: Casted from edata, final tidy data set.
