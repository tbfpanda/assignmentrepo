This is the codebook for the finaldataset variable at the end of the analysis, which stores
the tidy data set made.

All the variables which had mentions of mean and std were extracted from the data set. They are present as columns in the final data set.
These variables are named with the same alphanumeric characters and "_" replacing the special characters.
In each column of these variables the mean values per activity per subject are recorded.
